## Description

https://unusual-deer-dungarees.cyclic.app

Welcome to Wayfinder, your home for Pathfinder 2e knowledge and home to your future Pathfinder characters.

This was created as part of a project at Per Scholas to create a MERN stack based website.

This website uses an The PF2e OGL content API by Ravel (https://api.pathfinder2.fr/) to bring information on the ABC's of character creation.

And Class.

In addition, those who login to account will also have access to a character creator where they can make as many characters as their heart desires.
As well as edit them whenever and make room for more instantly.

## What is Pathfinder 2e

Pathfinder 2e is a Table Top Role-playing game or TTRPG made by Paizo. The original edition was an extension of the popular game Dungeons and Dragons and this new version expands upon the systems and really comes into it's own. At it's core, it is a fantasy role playing game known for it's extensive customization.

## Usage

The website will be very useful for people looking to get into Pathfinder 2e to learn about it and make characters.

## Technologies

-JavaScript
-React
-Mongoose
-Express
-Bootstrap
-NPM

## Technical Challenges

The JWT has been difficult overall and sometimes still malfunctions

and the deployment has been a major issue.

## Plans for the Future

I hope to eventually incorpate the more extensive parts of Pathfinder 2e's character creation such as feats and equipment.

I also hope to have implementation of Authorization features.

I hope to make the website look better as at the moment it is a bit rough to look at

but I also hope that I can put more of my own flair into it
